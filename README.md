# Next.js Project Setup and Basics.
- This project is a comprehensive introduction to setting up and working with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It guides you through creating a modern web application with reusable components, routing, API integration, and proper project structure. 

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
1. Understand how to scaffold a Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. Learn to implement basic routing in Next.js using the Pages Router
3. Create reusable components with TypeScript interfaces
4. Implement interactive UI elements like modals and buttons
5. Fetch and display data from external APIs
6. Structure a Next.js project following best practices
7. Work with component props and state management
8. Build responsive layouts with navigation

## Requirements
Technical Requirements
* Node.js (v16 or later)
* npm or yarn package manager
* Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript
* Familiarity with HTML/CSS
* Git and GitHub account
* Code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Functional Requirements
1. Project Structure:
    * Organize components by domain (layout, common, etc.)
    * Keep interfaces in a dedicated folder
    * Separate pages according to routes
2. Component Design:
    * Create reusable, modular components
    * Use TypeScript interfaces for props
    * Follow the single responsibility principle
3. Code Quality:
    * Use ESLint for linting
    * Maintain consistent code style
    * Add meaningful comments where necessary
4. Performance:
    * Optimize API calls
    * Implement lazy loading where appropriate
    * Use Tailwind CSS for efficient styling

## Best Practices
1. Component Organization
    * Follow a consistent folder structure
    * Separate layout components from page components
    * Keep components small and focused
2. Styling
    * Use Tailwindâ€™s utility classes effectively
    * Implement responsive design with a mobile-first approach
    * Maintain consistent spacing and typography
3. TypeScript
    * Define clear interfaces for all props
    * Type all components and functions properly
    * Use TypeScript to catch potential errors early
4. Performance
    * Optimize images for the web
    * Implement proper loading states
    * Consider lazy loading for non-critical components
5. Documentation:
    * Maintain a clear README
    * Document component props and usage
    * Keep commit messages descriptive
    * Expected Outcomes

## Implementation Guide
Start by setting up the Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
Implement basic routing with the Pages Router
Build reusable components one by one, starting with simple ones (Card, Button)
Progress to more complex components (Modal, PostCard, UserCard)
Implement the Header component for navigation
Fetch and display data from JSONPlaceholder API
Test each component and page as you build them

## Expected Outcomes
A fully functional Next.js application
Reusable components that follow TypeScript best practices
Proper routing between different pages
API integration to fetch and display data
Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
Clean, well-organized codebase
